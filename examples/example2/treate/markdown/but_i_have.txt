## But I Already Use Haml / Erubis / Builder and They're Great.

Repeat after me: Tater is _not_ Haml. 

### Tater is _not_ Haml.
#### Tater is _not_ Haml.
##### Tater is _not_ Haml.

**Tater** is not a templating engine. It's completely engine-agnostic. In fact, you can use Haml,
Erubis, Builder, Textile, and any other engine you want and still get the benefit of Tater's 
_actual_ features. Again, Tater doesn't care about what you're actually displaying in your templates,
just how they're ordered. You can sit a Haml file right next to an ERB file and a Builder file. Tater
doesn't know, or care, that you've done this.
