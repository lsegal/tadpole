        <h2>Templates for Ruby: The Object-Oriented Templating System</h2>

            <h2>What is This?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Tater Tots</strong> (or <em>Tater</em> for short) is an <em>object-oriented</em> templating system that doesn't care about
            what templating engines you like to use. It's kind of like a meta-templating engine, because it really
            only cares about where your templates come from-- not what's in them. All you have to give Tater is
            a list of "sections" that make up your template.</p>
            
            <h4>Wait, Did you say object oriented? <em>For files?</em></h4>
            
            <p>Yes. I did. <strong>Tater</strong>'s goal is to bring modularity to your templates by introducing this nifty new concept
            called <em>"Object-Oriented Programming"</em>. It allows you to essentially "subclass" a template from another one,
            inheriting all of the parent template's behaviour. It also allows you to solve another problem common to
            complex templates: <em>coupling</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Now bear with me here, coupling is considered a common problem in software, but you've probably never heard
            someone tell you that your templates files suffer from that problem. Coupling is a necessary dependency from
            one module to another, making it impossible to break the two modules apart. So when you directly call a template
            from one of your other template files, you are creating exactly that kind of coupling.</p>
            
            <p>How do we solve template coupling? <strong>Sections</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Sections?</h4>
            
            <p>You might know these as <em>partials</em>. But partials are <strong>ugly</strong>. Partials get lost deep inside your templates
            and never get out. Then, when you need to create a derivative template using everything but that one partial,
            you have to make yet another partial which includes the first one, or use some fancy if/then/else logic with
            crazy local variables to hide it from the original template. This gets messy fast, because it's all done 
            from <em>inside</em> the template.</p>
            
            <p>Sections are as simple as a list. In fact, the sections of a template are exactly that-- a list of sub-templates
            that make up the whole. You can compound as many of these lists as you want to create your abstracted template
            from nothing but a list of filenames-- then let <strong>Tater</strong> sort it out! </p>
            
            <p>If you need to visualize this concept, just think about all the templates and partials you used to create any
            page in your last website. List them in order from top to bottom, add in some heirarchy rules, and there you go, 
            you've just made a list of all of your template's sections. It's as simple as that.</p>

            <h2>But I Already Use Haml / Erubis / Builder and They're Great.</h2>
            
            <p>Repeat after me: Tater is <em>not</em> Haml. </p>
            
            <h3>Tater is <em>not</em> Haml.</h3>
            
            <h4>Tater is <em>not</em> Haml.</h4>
            
            <h5>Tater is <em>not</em> Haml.</h5>
            
            <p><strong>Tater</strong> is not a templating engine. It's completely engine-agnostic. In fact, you can use Haml,
            Erubis, Builder, Textile, and any other engine you want and still get the benefit of Tater's 
            <em>actual</em> features. Again, Tater doesn't care about what you're actually displaying in your templates,
            just how they're ordered. You can sit a Haml file right next to an ERB file and a Builder file. Tater
            doesn't know, or care, that you've done this.</p>
